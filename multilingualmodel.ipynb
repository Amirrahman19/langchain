       "[Document(page_content='prompt: What is cord blood?\\nresponse: Cord blood is blood that remains in the umbilical cord following the birth of a baby and after the umbilical cord is cut. During pregnancy, the umbilical cord functions as a lifeline between mother and child. After a babyï¿½s delivery, the cord blood present in the umbilical cord could offer hope for the child as well as members of the family. Cord blood contains a rich source of lifesaving stem cells called Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs).\\n: ', metadata={'source': 'What is cord blood?', 'row': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='prompt: What are cord blood stem cells?\\nresponse: Cord blood stem cells are also known as Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), which are responsible for replenishing blood and regenerating the immune system. These stem cells can be found within the umbilical cord following the birth of a baby and have the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types found in blood as depicted in the diagram below:     \\r\\nRed blood cells - which transport oxygen\\r\\nWhite blood cells - which produce antibodies and fight bacteria\\r\\nPlatelets - which assist in blood clotting\\n: ', metadata={'source': 'What are cord blood stem cells?', 'row': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: What happens after my baby's umbilical cord blood has been collected?\\nresponse: After the collection of your babyï¿½s umbilical cord blood, a round-the-clock medical courier will collect and deliver your babyï¿½s cord blood unit to Cordlifeï¿½s stem cell processing and storage laboratory within 24 hours.\\r\\nUpon receipt of your babyï¿½s cord blood unit, a Cordlife laboratory technician will start to isolate the stem cells ï¿½ a critical step in cord blood banking ï¿½ which will determine the number of stem cells that can be harvested or recovered from the cord blood.\\r\\nCell recovery rates are critical because a higher number of stem cells could enhance the success of cord blood transplantation or treatment. That's why Cordlife invests in the advanced AXPï¿½ II system to harvest maximum stem cells for improved transplant or treatment outcomes.\\r\\nThe AXPï¿½ II system is a U.S. FDA-cleared device that is capable of recovering more than 97% of viable CD34+ stem cells, higher than other available processing systems.3 This safe, sterile and automated cord blood processing system also helps to ensure your babyï¿½s cord blood is processed with highly precise, reliable, and state-of-the-art technology, hence eliminating any possible cross-contamination of the cord blood unit.\\r\\nOnce the stem cells have been isolated and stored in our connecting dual compartment cryobag, it is placed into a fully programmable and automated cryoprotectant infuser that allows for the consistent preparation of stem cells for cryopreservation. Unlike other devices that require manual handling, the infuser has high precision and is able to inject 0.5ml of cryoprotectant per minute at a constant flow rate and pre-defined temperature.\\r\\nAdvanced microstepping techniques are also employed to eliminate flow pulsation. Any deviation from this process may affect cell viability and potency. Therefore, automation with superior noise isolation and anti-vibration features helps to ensure that the cryoprotectant is homogeneously mixed with the cells to protect their viability and potency during cryopreservation.\\r\\n3 Rubinstein P.

This is because Cordlife conducts two different tests for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) on maternal blood, namely:                                                                  Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg).
