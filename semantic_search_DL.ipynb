That's why Cordlife invests in the advanced AXP� II system to harvest maximum stem cells for improved transplant or treatment outcomes.\\r\\nThe AXP� II system is a U.S. FDA-cleared device that is capable of recovering more than 97% of viable CD34+ stem cells, higher than other available processing systems.3 This safe, sterile and automated cord blood processing system also helps to ensure your baby�s cord blood is processed with highly precise, reliable, and state-of-the-art technology, hence eliminating any possible cross-contamination of the cord blood unit.\\r\\nOnce the stem cells have been isolated and stored in our connecting dual compartment cryobag, it is placed into a fully programmable and automated cryoprotectant infuser that allows for the consistent preparation of stem cells for cryopreservation. Unlike other devices that require manual handling, the infuser has high precision and is able to inject 0.5ml of cryoprotectant per minute at a constant flow rate and pre-defined temperature.\\r\\nAdvanced microstepping techniques are also employed to eliminate flow pulsation. Any deviation from this process may affect cell viability and potency. Therefore, automation with superior noise isolation and anti-vibration features helps to ensure that the cryoprotectant is homogeneously mixed with the cells to protect their viability and potency during cryopreservation.\\r\\n3 Rubinstein P.

       "  \"After the collection of your baby�s umbilical cord blood, a round-the-clock medical courier will collect and deliver your baby�s cord blood unit to Cordlife�s stem cell processing and storage laboratory within 24 hours.\\r\\nUpon receipt of your baby�s cord blood unit, a Cordlife laboratory technician will start to isolate the stem cells � a critical step in cord blood banking � which will determine the number of stem cells that can be harvested or recovered from the cord blood.\\r\\nCell recovery rates are critical because a higher number of stem cells could enhance the success of cord blood transplantation or treatment. That's why Cordlife invests in the advanced AXP� II system to harvest maximum stem cells for improved transplant or treatment outcomes.\\r\\nThe AXP� II system is a U.S. FDA-cleared device that is capable of recovering more than 97% of viable CD34+ stem cells, higher than other available processing systems.3 This safe, sterile and automated cord blood processing system also helps to ensure your baby�s cord blood is processed with highly precise, reliable, and state-of-the-art technology, hence eliminating any possible cross-contamination of the cord blood unit.\\r\\nOnce the stem cells have been isolated and stored in our connecting dual compartment cryobag, it is placed into a fully programmable and automated cryoprotectant infuser that allows for the consistent preparation of stem cells for cryopreservation. Unlike other devices that require manual handling, the infuser has high precision and is able to inject 0.5ml of cryoprotectant per minute at a constant flow rate and pre-defined temperature.\\r\\nAdvanced microstepping techniques are also employed to eliminate flow pulsation. Any deviation from this process may affect cell viability and potency. Therefore, automation with superior noise isolation and anti-vibration features helps to ensure that the cryoprotectant is homogeneously mixed with the cells to protect their viability and potency during cryopreservation.\\r\\n3 Rubinstein P.
