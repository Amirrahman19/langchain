       "[Document(page_content='prompt: Why should I save my baby’s cord blood stem cells?\\nresponse: There are several advantages of storing your baby’s cord blood stem cells, such as:\\n\\nA guaranteed match for autologous transplants (where the donor and recipient are the same individual)\\nHaving a readily available supply of stored Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) as opposed to conducting a national or international search, which can be costly and time-consuming during a time-critical situation\\nLower risk of Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) for autologous transplants, a situation where the transplanted tissue attacks the patient’s own tissue\\nNon-invasive collection procedure which is pain-free and risk-free to both mother and child\\nCord blood stem cells are younger, have a higher rate of engraftment and are more tolerant to tissue mismatches, compared to other sources of stem cells, e.g. bone marrow\\n: ', metadata={'source': 'Why should I save my baby’s cord blood stem cells?', 'row': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='prompt: How can the storage of cord blood stem cells benefit my family?\\nresponse: Apart from being a perfect match for your child, cord blood can also be used by family members. Unlike bone marrow which requires a perfect match between donor and patient, the probability of finding a match among family members using cord blood stem cells is higher. In addition, the chances of finding a suitable match within the family increases with the storage of every additional child’s cord blood.                                                                                                \\nParent’s Guide to Cord Blood FAQ.

       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: What happens after my baby's umbilical cord blood has been collected?\\nresponse: After the collection of your baby’s umbilical cord blood, a round-the-clock medical courier will collect and deliver your baby’s cord blood unit to Cordlife’s stem cell processing and storage laboratory within 24 hours.\\nUpon receipt of your baby’s cord blood unit, a Cordlife laboratory technician will start to isolate the stem cells – a critical step in cord blood banking – which will determine the number of stem cells that can be harvested or recovered from the cord blood.\\nCell recovery rates are critical because a higher number of stem cells could enhance the success of cord blood transplantation or treatment. That's why Cordlife invests in the advanced AXP® II system to harvest maximum stem cells for improved transplant or treatment outcomes.\\nThe AXP® II system is a U.S. FDA-cleared device that is capable of recovering more than 97% of viable CD34+ stem cells, higher than other available processing systems.3 This safe, sterile and automated cord blood processing system also helps to ensure your baby’s cord blood is processed with highly precise, reliable, and state-of-the-art technology, hence eliminating any possible cross-contamination of the cord blood unit.\\nOnce the stem cells have been isolated and stored in our connecting dual compartment cryobag, it is placed into a fully programmable and automated cryoprotectant infuser that allows for the consistent preparation of stem cells for cryopreservation. Unlike other devices that require manual handling, the infuser has high precision and is able to inject 0.5ml of cryoprotectant per minute at a constant flow rate and pre-defined temperature.\\nAdvanced microstepping techniques are also employed to eliminate flow pulsation. Any deviation from this process may affect cell viability and potency. Therefore, automation with superior noise isolation and anti-vibration features helps to ensure that the cryoprotectant is homogeneously mixed with the cells to protect their viability and potency during cryopreservation.\\n3 Rubinstein P.
