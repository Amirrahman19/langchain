What is cord blood?,"Cord blood is blood that remains in the umbilical cord following the birth of a baby and after the umbilical cord is cut. During pregnancy, the umbilical cord functions as a lifeline between mother and child. After a baby’s delivery, the cord blood present in the umbilical cord could offer hope for the child as well as members of the family. Cord blood contains a rich source of lifesaving stem cells called Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs).",
What are cord blood stem cells?,"Cord blood stem cells are also known as Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), which are responsible for replenishing blood and regenerating the immune system. These stem cells can be found within the umbilical cord following the birth of a baby and have the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types found in blood as depicted in the diagram below:     
Red blood cells - which transport oxygen
White blood cells - which produce antibodies and fight bacteria
Platelets - which assist in blood clotting                                        ",
Why should I save my baby’s cord blood stem cells?,"There are several advantages of storing your baby’s cord blood stem cells, such as:

A guaranteed match for autologous transplants (where the donor and recipient are the same individual)
Having a readily available supply of stored Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) as opposed to conducting a national or international search, which can be costly and time-consuming during a time-critical situation
Lower risk of Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) for autologous transplants, a situation where the transplanted tissue attacks the patient’s own tissue
Non-invasive collection procedure which is pain-free and risk-free to both mother and child
Cord blood stem cells are younger, have a higher rate of engraftment and are more tolerant to tissue mismatches, compared to other sources of stem cells, e.g. bone marrow",
What can cord blood stem cells do?,"Cord blood stem cells can:

Replace and regenerate damaged or diseased bone marrow.
Treat blood related cancers, solid tumours and immunodeficiency disorders.
Correct genetic defects (sibling/allogeneic transplantation).
Potentially be used for cellular therapy and regenerative medicine.erative medicine.",
How does a cord blood stem cell transplant work?,"The purpose of a stem cell treatment is to reconstitute a patient’s blood and immune system.

For example, in the case of a cancer-related transplant, chemotherapy and radiotherapy will have to take place before the infusion of cord blood stem cells. The cord blood stem cells will be infused intravenously into the patient’s blood stream, where they will migrate to the patient’s bone marrow. Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), which can be found in umbilical cord blood will differentiate itself into three blood cell types – red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, a process which initiates the regeneration of the patient’s blood and immune system.",
What are some of the diseases that can be treated using cord blood stem cells?,"Cord blood stem cells are currently being used as a standard form of treatment for over 80 diseases such as leukaemia, lymphoma, thalassemia and neuroblastoma, just to name a few. For the full list of treatable diseases:

",
How can the storage of cord blood stem cells benefit my family?,"Apart from being a perfect match for your child, cord blood can also be used by family members. Unlike bone marrow which requires a perfect match between donor and patient, the probability of finding a match among family members using cord blood stem cells is higher. In addition, the chances of finding a suitable match within the family increases with the storage of every additional child’s cord blood.

Accessed November 11, 2019.",
How is my baby's umbilical cord blood collected by my OBGYN?,"Immediately after the delivery of your baby, your child’s umbilical cord will be clamped and cut, and your child will be moved to the birthing area. The doctor then collects the umbilical cord blood by inserting a needle into the umbilical vein, draining the cord blood into a blood bag.

This procedure is non-invasive in nature, and is both painless and risk-free to mother and child. The process takes about 3 minutes and does not alter the birthing process in any way. It can be done with either a vaginal or caesarean delivery.

Please note that the final decision of whether the cord blood collection should take place will always reside with your OBGYN or Doctor whose first priority is to ensure the safety of you and your baby.",
What happens after my baby's umbilical cord blood has been collected?,"After the collection of your baby’s umbilical cord blood, a round-the-clock medical courier will collect and deliver your baby’s cord blood unit to Cordlife’s stem cell processing and storage laboratory within 24 hours.
Upon receipt of your baby’s cord blood unit, a Cordlife laboratory technician will start to isolate the stem cells – a critical step in cord blood banking – which will determine the number of stem cells that can be harvested or recovered from the cord blood.
Cell recovery rates are critical because a higher number of stem cells could enhance the success of cord blood transplantation or treatment. That's why Cordlife invests in the advanced AXP® II system to harvest maximum stem cells for improved transplant or treatment outcomes.
The AXP® II system is a U.S. FDA-cleared device that is capable of recovering more than 97% of viable CD34+ stem cells, higher than other available processing systems.3 This safe, sterile and automated cord blood processing system also helps to ensure your baby’s cord blood is processed with highly precise, reliable, and state-of-the-art technology, hence eliminating any possible cross-contamination of the cord blood unit.
Once the stem cells have been isolated and stored in our connecting dual compartment cryobag, it is placed into a fully programmable and automated cryoprotectant infuser that allows for the consistent preparation of stem cells for cryopreservation. Unlike other devices that require manual handling, the infuser has high precision and is able to inject 0.5ml of cryoprotectant per minute at a constant flow rate and pre-defined temperature.
Advanced microstepping techniques are also employed to eliminate flow pulsation. Any deviation from this process may affect cell viability and potency. Therefore, automation with superior noise isolation and anti-vibration features helps to ensure that the cryoprotectant is homogeneously mixed with the cells to protect their viability and potency during cryopreservation.

How is my baby's cord blood stored?,"Your baby's umbilical cord blood is stored within a US FDA-approved cryogenic storage pouch made of a special material that is specifically designed to withstand cryogenic temperatures. The pouch has two main segments (20% and 80%) that are attached integrally, and two test segments that are also integrally attached. The integral segments allow for additional testing on the associated unit to ensure that no samples are mixed up and that the cord blood remains viable. These tests are typically performed prior to a transplant. Having dual integrated segments addresses the possibility of future stem cell expansion. This means that when stem cell expansion is available commercially, you will be able to withdraw a portion of the stem cells for expansion while keeping the remainder in storage.",
How long can my baby's umbilical cord blood stem cells be stored?,"Research has shown that cord blood which has been processed according to international standards and stored at cryogenic temperatures can be stored indefinitely and still remain viable4. 4 Karlsson J, Toner M. Long-term storage of tissues by cryopreservation: critical issues. Biomaterials. 1996;17:243-256.",
Can I store my baby's cord blood if my blood sample is tested positive for Hepatitis B?,"You may still continue to store your baby's cord blood (with additional consent given to Cordlife), or elect to discard the umbilical cord blood unit.  This is because Cordlife conducts two different tests for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) on maternal blood, namely:                                                                  Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg).                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hepatitis B Core Antibody (Anti-HBc (Total)).                                                                                                                                                                                     Usually, the attending transplant physician will make the decision whether to use an umbilical cord blood unit where the maternal blood was tested positive for Hepatitis B for transplant, based on various factors particular to the patient, the cord blood unit intended for use, and the availability of other HLA-matched donor.",

Are pregnant mothers more susceptible to contracting COVID-19?,"According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) as well as the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant mothers are more at risk of getting infected with COVID-19.1,2

However, pregnant mothers who have viral respiratory infections may be at greater risk of developing severe symptoms. 2 Given that the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of many respiratory infections, see a doctor immediately if you are experiencing symptoms such as cough and fever.

If you are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is absolutely crucial to observe personal hygiene by washing your hands with soap frequently and also avoid travelling to crowded places. If travelling is essential, always wear a face mask.",
Can the COVID-19 virus be transmitted to the unborn baby during pregnancy?,"Evidence suggests that COVID-19 is mostly spread from person to person through close contact with air droplets that carry the virus and are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to the CDC, mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy is unlikely.1

In a recent case study of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 who had caesarean deliveries, none of the babies tested positive for COVID-19. In addition, the virus was not detected in cord blood, throat swabs, amniotic fluid, or other maternal samples collected.3

However, early research from China suggests that the COVID-19 virus could be passed from mother to child after the baby is born. According to a widely cited and shared research letter from Wuhan, China, COVID-19 was found in three out of 33 babies born to COVID-19-positive mothers through caesarean delivery. Even though the three newborns showed symptoms of fever and pneumonia right after birth, all of them have recovered and were tested negative for COVID-19 within a span of one week.4

Hence, it can't be ruled out that COVID-19 could be passed on to the baby through close contact. In this case, the mother may want to consider getting additional help to care for the baby until she is fully recovered.",
Will my baby’s cord blood contain the COVID-19 virus?,"As far as we know, your baby’s cord blood will not contain the COVID-19 strain, even if the mother is a carrier. Typically, when a mother is sick with a respiratory virus, it is very rare for the virus to be present in the cord blood.5,6,7

A retrospective study conducted in Wuhan, China, on nine pregnant women in their third trimester who all had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19 has also provided further reassurance that the virus is unlikely to be present in cord blood and birth tissues. The study's nine livebirths were all COVID-19 negative, with no severe perinatal asphyxia. 3 Perinatal asphyxia is defined as a lack of blood flow or oxygen to or from the foetus in the period immediately before, during, or after the birth process.8 Furthermore, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples of the newborns were also COVID-19 negative at the point of birth.3

A recent study on 38 pregnant women and their newborns in China assessed the effects of COVID-19 and the virus's transmissibility from mother to foetus. The findings also revealed that the COVID-19 virus did not cause maternal death and that there were no cases of COVID-19 intrauterine transmission from mothers to their foetuses. Furthermore, neonatal specimens and placentas were tested negative for the virus in some cases. ",
"Is it safe to have cord blood, cord lining and cord tissue collected during this pandemic?","As cord blood will be collected by your caregiver immediately after the delivery of your baby, the collection of cord blood, cord lining, and cord tissue remains safe even during this pandemic period.

Emerging evidence is now suggesting that the risk of direct transmission at the point of delivery is low, and there was no detection of the COVID-19 virus strain within the maternal and neonatal samples that can be transmitted to the umbilical cord blood and cord tissue.9

In most, if not all, cases of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission globally, the virus is spread mainly through close interaction with an infected person, where respiratory secretions can enter the eyes, mouth, nose, or airways, and via the touching of a surface or an object that is contaminated with the respiratory droplets.10

Cordlife is listed as an essential service provider during this pandemic. Our laboratory operations remain unaffected, and we will adhere to the most stringent protocols to ensure that your baby’s cord blood, cord lining and cord tissue are safely collected, processed, and cryopreserved.",
Can Mesenchymal Stem Cells be used to treat COVID-19?,"At this juncture, there is little or no conclusive evidence to prove that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) can help treat COVID-19. It is important to note that the major risk factor in COVID-19 mortality is the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill patients, among other considerations such as age and pre-existing medical conditions.11 According to the European Respiratory Journal, MSC treatment was given to ARDS patients who had respiratory infections caused by the influenza virus (H7N1) and was found to be a viable treatment that resulted in a shorter ICU stay and faster recovery in patients11

A recent pilot study was conducted in Wuhan, China, in which seven COVID-19 patients received allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) infusions. Among the seven patients, three (two moderate and one severe) had recovered and were discharged 10 days after the treatment. The results may suggest that MSCs could be used to treat or significantly improve the patients' conditions. 12

The World Health Organization (WHO) and several U.S. agencies, led by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are looking into using expanded MSCs as a possible treatment for COVID-19. 13 The limited but emerging evidence regarding MSCs in managing COVID-19 suggests an urgent mandate for more clinical trials to determine the direct impact these regenerative cells have on patient recovery, which may point in favour of uncovering the potential applications of MSCs to treat COVID-19.",
